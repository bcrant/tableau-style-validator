# Tableau Style Validator

## Inspiration
In my new role I am working on customer facing dashboards, and part of my responsibility is to enforce the style standards of the platform where the dashboards are embedded onto the dashboards.

As someone who is colorblind, I decided it was best to outsource this responsibility to a computer. In addition, Tableau dashboards can include many hidden components that may go unnoticed in code review and quality assurance stages of release.

## What it does
The Tableau Style Validator tests a Workbook for compliance with a given set of design style standards. Company colors, specific fonts, font sizes are the primary scope, but dashboard styles like Borders, Margins, Padding, Backgrounds, etc are able to be tested as well.

In the full cloud deployment of the project, Tableau Style Validator is triggered anytime a Tableau Workbook is created or updated on your Tableau Server and returns the validation as a Slack message via Slack Bot to a specified channel in your Slack Workspace. 

It can also be run from the command line given a Tableau Workbook `.twb` and Style Guide (see `example_style_guide.json`).

## How we built it
See [Tableau Style Validator Architecture](https://briancrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/TableauStyleValidatorArchitecture.pdf) for a breakdown of the projects inner-workings. 

## Challenges we ran into
I was slowed down for about a week troubleshooting my local environment on new work laptop with Mac M1 chip.
I'll spare you _all_ the details since it is not of much interest to this project, but sparknotes version is...
- the Mac M1 chip is not fully supported on Python 3.8 
- the current AWS Lambda Python runtime is Python 3.8
- not all the Python libraries used in this project are compatible with Python 3.8 on the Mac M1 chip

I ended up having install Docker using Rosetta, a terminal able to translate distributions built for x86-64 processor to arm64 (Mac M1), use that version of Docker to build the Python 3.8 dependencies for AWS Lambda, but some Python packages in this project are not compatible with Python 3.8 on Mac M1, so I ended having to build a separate environment on Python 3.9 locally.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Helping out my fellow 8% of humans that are colorblind.
- Getting the project this far (releasable) in just a few weeks.
- This is my first project to include multiple options for deployment 
    - Run locally as a script
    - Run via command line interface 
    - Deploy via serverless cloud implementation

## What we learned
Time permitting, I would love to have taken what I have learned about the structure of Tableau XML documents and expand the Tableau Document API to permit updates to workbooks based on the Style Validator.

## What's next for Tableau Style Validator
- Refactor validate_styles... got messy rushing to add Slack functionality today
- Add formatted Slack output for all style elements
  - Slack output is missing some of CLI features: Padding, Margins, Borders       
- Add support for Mark colors
- Add support for Table style elements
  - Logic complete, just need outputs
- Add flags to enable / disable testing against certain elements (padding, margins, etc) or test only font styles for instance.â€¨
